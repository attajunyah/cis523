Your models can't deal with blank values.\n","\n","My strategy is to load the test table, the one you created in the wrangling notebook. \n","When you get a new \"row\" from the user, add it on to the end of (a copy of) the test table.\n","\n","Then run your pipeline on this new copy. This should wrangle your new row into shape.\n","\n","Now you can pull it back off the end and you have a row ready for prediction.

You have to make sure that I can run it. If you are serving off of localhost without ngrok, I likely won't be able to actually run your server and see results.

For two-person teams, I would like you to set up a persistent web server that I (and your future employment interviewers) can use. I did see this new tool for migration from notebook to cloud service but it looks like it might be complicated to use: https://ploomber.readthedocs.io/en/latest/get-started/what-is.html.
